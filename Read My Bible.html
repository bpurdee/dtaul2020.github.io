					<h1>The Gospel Foretold- Isaiah 53</h1>
					<p>"Who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed? He grew up before him like a tender shoot, and like a root out of dry ground. He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, nothing in his appearance that we should desire him. He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows, and familiar with suffering. Like one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not. Surely he took up our infirmities and carried our sorrows, yet, we considered him stricken by God, smitten by him, and afflicted. But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed. We, all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to his own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all. He was oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth; he was led like a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is silent, so he did not open his mouth. By oppression and judgment he was taken away. And who can speak of his descendants? For he was cut off from the land of the living; for the transgression of my people he was stricken. He was assigned a grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death, though he had done no violence, nor was any deceit in his mouth. Yet it was the LORD's will to crush him and cause him to suffer, and though the LORD makes his life a guilt offering, he will see his offspring and prolong his days, and the will of the LORD will prosper in his hand. After the suffering of his soul, he will see the light of life and be satisfied; by his knowledge my righteous servant will justify many and he will bear their iniquities. Therefore I will give him a portion among the great, and he will divide the spoils with the strong, because he poured out his life unto death, and was numbered with the transgressors. For he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors." </p>
					<p> This is one of the messages of the Gospel. The Gospel is known as the "Good News." Some of you may ask "Good News to what?" The Good News of Salvation and Redemption! The whole message is about Jesus Christ! He is the one who grew up like a tender shoot. He did not come like the Jews and the Gentiles thought of: a king dressed up in robes and royalty. Do you want to know how Jesus came into this world? He came as a baby born from a virgin woman named Mary. He was born in a stable and laid on a manger. The angels and the Lord God told everyone that Jesus would come and save the world from sin and save His people. Jesus grew up and lived a life on Earth only He was also God, the Son. He was fully God and fully man.</p>
					<p> He lived a perfect life and healed the sick, gave sight to the blind, made the lame walk, brought people back from the dead, and taught many lessons to people. He told them about God and revealed Himself in parables. But there were people that did not like that. Jesus knew that this would happen. He even told His disciples that He was sent on Earth to die but He would rise from the grave and conquer sin and death and that He would ascend into Heaven. One night, it finally happened! </p>
					<p> Jesus was arrested and was sent to die on a cross. He was beaten, mocked, teased, spit on, and His clothes were torn. He was given a crown of thorns and on His cross it was named "King of the Jews." He died that horrible death for us so that <b>we</b> could live in eternity with Him. Then He was put in a grave. BUT after 3 days, <b>HE ROSE FROM THE GRAVE</b>! That is the Gospel! I believe in it with all of my heart! How about you? Can you see that you need a Savior in your life? All you need to do is repent from your sin, believe that Jesus came and died for you and that He is risen, and ask for His forgiveness. And I promise you your life will be changed! He will take you in and love you with open arms. </p>

					<h1>Trust in the Lord- Proverbs 3: 5-8</h1>
					<p>"Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make your paths straight. Do not be wise in your own eyes; fear the LORD and shun evil. This will bring health to your body and nourishment to your bones." Sometimes we feel like we need to have an answer right now for a lot of things in our life. It is especially difficult for me. I get stressed out very easily and it is hard to put your trust to someone else. What I have learned is that God knows what's in your heart, your mind, your soul, and everything inside and outside of you. He created you the way you are for a reason: to glorify Him in everything you do and say. When I put my trust in the LORD, part of me feels anxious but it also comforts me to know that He will never leave me nor forsake me. He has got me in His righteous right hand. It requires patience and prayer and leaning onto Him instead of myself. Not stressing about it and leaning onto the Lord will make you healthy and strong in heart and mind and soul. The Book of Proverbs is a book filled with wisdom written by King Solomon. The Bible is <b>all</b> true. These verses take a huge affect in my life and I have to apply it every day and believe that God is in control. What about you? Do you know and believe that you can trust God to take care of His people including yourself? Trust can be hard to do but to God, nothing is impossible with Him!

					<h1>The Proverbs 31 Woman- Proverbs 31:10-31</h1>
					<p>"A wife of noble character who can find? She is worth far more than rubies. Her husband has full confidence in her and lacks nothing of value. She brings him good, not harm, all the days of her life. She selects wool and flax and works with eager hands. She is like the merchant ships, bringing her food from afar. She gets up while it is still dark; she provides food for her family and portions for her servant girls. She considers a field and buys it; out of her earnings she plants a vineyard. She sets about her work vigorously; her arms are strong for her tasks. She sees that her trading is profitable and her lamp does not go out at night. In her hand she holds the distaff and grasps the spindle with her fingers. She opens her arms to the poor and extends her hands to the needy. When it snows, she has no fear for her household; for all of them are clothed in scarlet. She makes coverings for her bed; she is clothed in fine linen and purple. Her husband is respected at the city gate, where he takes his seat among the elders of the land. She makes linen garments and sells them, and supplies the  merchants with sashes. She is clothed with strength and dignity; she can laugh at the days to come. She speaks with wisdom, and faithful instructions is on her tongue. She watches over the affairs of her household, and does not eat the bread of idleness. Her children arise and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her. Many women do noble things, but you surpass them all. Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting; but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised. Give her the reward she has earned, and let her works bring her praise at the city gate." </p>
					<p>Men, wake up and smell the roses! This is a woman that you need to have for your spouse or for your girlfriend. Women, this is a reminder to us all that being this type of woman is honorable and noble. Being this type of woman it takes work but it is rewarding. You may not know it now but later on you will realize that this type of woman is known to be someone who serves the LORD while also being a mother to her family or a supporter to the man in her life. Men, treat your Proverbs 31 woman with respect, kindness, and like a queen. She deserves it! </p>
					<p> The one person in my life that is a Proverbs 31 woman is my mother. She gets up early everyday to make breakfast for herself and for her family, she goes to work with strength, she loves everyone who she comes to meet even the ones who feel poor and needy, she speaks with wisdom especially when she reminds me of Scripture, she gives faithful instruction, she goes and gets food from afar, and she is fully praised from me, my sister, and my father. She is a great example in my life and I would want to follow her example and apply it to my life and to apply being a Proverbs 31 woman to whoever I am marrying or to my boyfriend. </p>
					<p>So to the Proverbs 31 women, I praise you for all that you are and I pray that the Lord will bless everyone of you. You are filled with the Gospel and you deserve to be recognized. </p>

					<h1>A Great Picture of Marriage- Ecclesiastes 4:9-12</h1>
					<p>"Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their work: If one falls down, his friend can help him up. But pity the man who falls and has no one to help him up! Also, if two lie down together, they will keep warm. But how can one keep warm alone? Though one may be overpowered, two can defend themselves. A cord of three strands is not quickly broken." This is one of the many great pictures of marriage in the Bible. Two are better than one because the two becomes one flesh. The husband and the wife work together and if one falls, the other helps him or her up with encouragement, comfort, and with the Lord as their center in their lives. Two can defend themselves but who is the third in their lives? Jesus! With Jesus being the center and the husband and wife the other two, it makes a cord of three strands. This cord will not be quickly broken. With God in marriage and in life, what could break us from that bond? That is one of the things about marriage that I would want: me and my future husband to be the two strands connected to Jesus forever and not being broken from that bond. Another thing I would want in marriage is compromise. Throughtout my childhood, my parents had a difficulty in learning how to compromise when they quarreled. It was annoying and upsetting to me so I told myself: when I get married, I would want us both to compromise with the Lord by our side and directing us to what we need to do. Compromise solves problems but a cord of three strands stays together. So to my married couples out there, be the two strands connected to the third strand who brought you two together for a reason and always be able to compromise; it works!

					<h1>Faith is Important- James 2:26</h1>
					<p>"As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without deeds is dead." This verse definitely applies to me when searching for a library job. Before this verse rung in my head, I was a lazy person when trying to find a library job because I thought that if I applied for a job today, I should get a phone call and get accepted just like that but then I learned that it takes more action than just that. I needed to have faith and believe that God would point me to the direction of where He needed me and where He was. So I changed my strategy: I prayed after every time I applied for a job asking Jesus that if this was where He needed me, then reveal it to me. If not, then keep guiding me to where He needed me. I also got dressed up and went to those places to introduce myself and telling them that I am wanting to work in a library but they told me to keep applying online and wait to hear a call. But at least they knew who I was. Every once in a while, I would drop by again and see about any updates. They always said no so I kept trying with the little faith that I had. I will still keep trying with the faith that I have because without it it is dead. I do not want my faith to die; I want it to live with the thought of Jesus being in control and doing more actions with the faith that I have. If I keep doing that, then who knows? I might be a librarian. Have faith in the Lord and do actions because without that, your faith would be dead and feeling like you do not care. If you care so much about anything, then have faith with action! I am not giving up and you should not either.

 		<h3> <i>Who is Danielle Taulman?</i> </h3>
  			<p class="about me">Hello my fellow readers! My name is Danielle Taulman. I am a graduate student at UNCG going for my Master's Degree in Library Science. I have always loved to read.  In my early youth, I read many biographies about U.S. presidents and historical fiction series books.  My parents were intrigued to see me read books that were typically discovered at a later age. I still enjoy reading these genres today.My passion for the library has led me to work at the Gaston County Public Library, the York County Library, and at UNC Charlotteâ€™s J. Murrey Atkins Library as a Library Assistant in Circulation, Children's Department, and Special Collections.   Working at these libraries have opened doors of opportunities for me to continue with my studies to pursue future positions of leadership in the librarian field. I believe that books are never meant to be thrown away; books are meant to educate and capture the hearts of readers and scholars.</p>
